# Tests Directory

At the moment, the tests are broken up into two sets. `unit_tests` ensures that
the PluginPlay framework is working. `examples` is a very bare bones example of
a typical use of PluginPlay.

The tests should be setup such that:

```.py
python3 run_test.py
```

will run the tests in both `examples` and `unit_tests` without any additional
setup.
