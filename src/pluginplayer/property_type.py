class PropertyType:
    """Defines an effective function API for calling a Module.

    All Module instances actually are invoked like:

    .. code-block:: py

       mod = module.Module()
       results = mod.run(inputs)

    where both results and inputs are kwargs-like.

    Particluarly in C++ the wrapping and unwrapping of the the inputs and
    results is a lot of nasty, heavily templated boilerplate. For this reason we
    came up with the "property type" concept. Each property type defines a
    mapping from positional arguments to their elements in the inputs/results
    maps passed to ``Module.run``. Using the property type ``PT`` a call to run
    a ``Module`` looks more like:

    .. code-block:: py

       result0, result1, result2 = module.run_as(PT, input0, input1)


    Users are expected to use the PropertyType class by inheriting from it. Then
    in the ctor of the derived class they should set the inputs and results
    members. For example to implement the class for ``PT`` above:

    .. code-block:: py

        class PTClass(property_type.PropertyType):

            def __init__(self):
                inputs = [('input0', None), ('input1', None)]
                results = ['result0', 'result1', 'result2']
                return super().__init__(inputs, results)

    If applicable the ``None`` values could be replaced with default values.

        # A list of pairs, 0-th element is name, 1-st is defaul value
